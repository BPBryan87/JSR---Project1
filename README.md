I had trouble logging the names and then getting it to show up on the prompt and then add it to the list.
My idea was for to have prompts show up for each question and then submit the answers then add them to the list.
Each time I tried the prompts the code wouldn't run.

Sorry for this incomplete work. I was struggling a bit. Thanks for you feedback.
