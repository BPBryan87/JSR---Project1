I had trouble logging the names and then getting it to show up on the prompt and then to have the correct output items.
My idea was for to have prompts show up for each question and then submit the answers then add them to the list but it didn't work out originally. Each time I tried the prompts the code wouldn't run. In order to complete a working function of the chatbot, I had to copy some of the function code base of the person who presented last week (I believe it was Christine but not sure).
